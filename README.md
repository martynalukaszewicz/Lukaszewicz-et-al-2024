### Authors: Martyna Lukaszewicz, Benjamin J. Ridenhour, Eva M. Top, Thibault Stalder





In the directory where the software folders are located, are the output files of clusters, contig names, contig lengths, and replicates. This directory is located at "~/contig_ids_per_clusters/".

In the directory where the software folders are located, are the output files of CheckM reports.  This directory is located at "~/report/".





1. Run the prepare_data_for_similarity_analysis.R script to create and save data.tsv and metadata.tsv files per software. The script is located at "~/contig_ids_per_clusters/".

2. Run the DistancebyLength.R script to calculate dissimilarity values (Jaccard distances) and generate dissimilarity plots. The script is located at "~/".
